[2] "During the first wave all in March 2020, all activity was moved to a different hospital in the trust. One list per week was also being carried out in the independent sector. During the second wave, we have been working at our usual base hospital with the private wing being used for elective admissions. Although the vaccine is not a must, once the patient has been listed for surgery, then efforts are made to vaccinate the patient prior to procedure. In outpatients, a good proportion of the followups are being done remotely and face to afce reserved for cervix and vulval cancer FU mainly. PIFU has also been introduced. New patients are seen face to face as far as possible."
